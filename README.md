# Python Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects I've built while learning and experimenting with various concepts. Each folder represents a standalone project that explores different areas such as APIs, automation, data handling, and GUI applications.

## Projects

- **fitness-tracker-app**  
  A console or GUI-based app that tracks workout or activity metrics, possibly using an API like Sheety or a Google Sheets integration.

  A password manager app built with a GUI (Tkinter) to generate, store, and retrieve passwords securely.

- **flight-deals-app**  
  An app that scrapes or queries flight data APIs to notify users of cheap flight deals.

  A simple app to convert miles to kilometers, likely a beginner-friendly GUI or CLI utility.

  Another version of a password manager—perhaps an earlier or alternate version of the solution above.

- **police-checker**  
  Possibly a web scraper or API client to check police data or alerts for a certain location.

  A trivia-style app that presents questions and tracks the score, possibly with a GUI or using the Open Trivia Database API.
